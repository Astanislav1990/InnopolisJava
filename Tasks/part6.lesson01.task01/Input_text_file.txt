He has short dark hair and gray eyes. He is a very hardworking man.
He is rather strict with us, but always fair.
My elder brother Ken is thirteen, and he is very clever.
He is good at Maths and always helps me with it, because I can hardly understand all these sums and problems.
Ken has red hair and brown eyes. My name is Jessica.
I am eleven. I have long dark hair and brown eyes.
I am not as clever as my brother, though I try to do my best at school too.
I am fond of dancing. Our dancing studio won The Best Dancing Studio 2015 competition last month.
I am very proud of it. I also like to help my mother with my little sister very much. Our family is very united.
We love each other and always try to spend more time together.
